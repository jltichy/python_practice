Here I will create mini programs/exercises to execute tasks of interest.

1. Create a new git repository with a test branch.  Write a python program where you enter your birthday and it tells you how many days you have been alive. Look at the following modules: sys, os, datetime, and time.  Also, read about writing and reading to files (http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex16.html).  Use this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/415511/how-to-get-current-time-in-python

2.  Write another python program where you enter a word and a number and it writes a file showing that word the number of times that you enter it.  E.g. "hello  5" would create a file that looks like:

hello
hello
hello
hello
hello

Push both of these programs to your test branch.  You will need to read about for loops, open files, close files.
